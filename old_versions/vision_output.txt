the split between his head and his heart has widened
to give him tragic stature. When his beloved daughter
collapsed at his feet, brought down by his teaching, he is
compelled to reassess the very basis of his system, and the
delicacy with which Dickens shows Gradgrind facing this
painfully humbling task gives the final chapters moving
poignancy.
For Dickens, Mr Gradgrind is the representative of
widely prevalent and deeply pernicious ideas about man and
society. These ideas can be broadly labelled as Utilitarian-
ism and Political Economy. Strictly speaking, the two con
cepts are not synonymous, but they are closely related
and for Dickens they came to the same thing in the end.
Utilitarianism was the brainchild of Jeremy Bentham
(1748-1832), a personally eccentric philosopher and social
reformer, who held that virtue was a matter of utility: an
action was good if it helped to bring about the greatest hap-
piness of the greatest number. Promulgation of that hap-
piness was the function of the State, and education of the
populace and extension of political franchise were fun.
damental tenets of Benthamism. Political Economy, on the
other hand, was a socio-economic system deriving
Adam Smith (1723-90) and David Ricardo (1772-1023)
whose disciples taught that the distribution of wealth was
governed by immutable laws of nature. National prospe
depended on the profits of industrialists, and the we
of workers could not rise without jeopardizing econ
harmony, to the detriment of workers and industrialists
alike. Because the pursuit of individual self-interest was held
to promote the general welfare, the duty of the state was to
adopt a policy of laissez-faire, in order to allow that inevitable
process to operate freely, without interference.
Historically, these approaches made genuine contributions
to social progress in nineteenth-century England: legislative
and legal reforms, revision of the penal code, and develop-
ment of public administration were among the legacies of
Benthamism; massive industrial expansion took place in the
laissez-faire economy. But to Dickens, as to Carlyle, such
theories were anathema. As in his attack on the Poor Laws
(one of the first major Benthamite reforms) in Oliver Twist,
Dickens was less concerned with the rationale of specific
policies than with the general attitude which lay behind them.
For him, Utilitarianism and Political Economy were based on
a fallacious conception of human nature. Their trust in
economic forces and their reliance on statistical evidence
made no allowance for noble human qualities such as
generosity, altruism, and imaginative sympathy; their con-
cern with quantitative analysis made them insensitive to the
lot of the individual; and their high-minded notions of general
prosperity were, he considered, so much cant to justify
selfishness. Moreover, the utter certitude with which these
theories were proclaimed as ineluctable laws of nature made
their proponents a target ripe for challenge. As he wrote to
Charles Knight, â€˜My satire is against those who see figures
and averages, and nothing else--the representatives of the
wickedest and most enormous vice of this time.'3
13 Knight was an active promoter of the Society for the Diffusion of Practical
Knowledge, and the publication of his defence of Utilitarian principles, Knowledge is
Power, in January 1854, just as Dickens was beginning to write Hard Times, was an
undoubted spur to Dickens's thinking. See J. T. Boulton, Charles Knight and
Charles Dickens: Knowledge is Power and Hard Times', Dickensian, 50 (1954), 57-63.
Dickens's letter continues by fulminating against 'the addled heads who would take
the average of cold in the Crimea during twelve months as a reason for clothing a
soldier in nankeens on a night when he would be frozen to death in fur, and who would
comfort the labourer in travelling twelve miles a day to and from his work, by telling
him that the average distance of one inhabited place from another in the whole area
of England, is not more than four miles' (Nonesuch Letters, ii. 620).
