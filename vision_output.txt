That system, planned for service in\nDecember 1988, is called Hawaii 4/Transpacific 3. After that system\nis in place. AT&T\'s cable ship will install another 1500-mile section\nfrom Guam to the Philippines. That system is tentatively set for ser-\nvice in 1989.\nreported experimental results in the amplification and reshaping of optical soli\ntons in glass fibers.\nIn concluding the article, the author states that, \xe2\x80\x9cThe ideas outlined here\nwill soon be given experimental test in a closed loop of fiber whose length will\ncorrespond to one amplification period in a real system. Pulses will be injected\ninto the loop where, as solitons, they will circulate many times. If those experi-\nments are successful, the day of the elegantly simple, all optical communications\nsystem cannot be far off."\nHOLOGRAPHY\nThere are many other extensive fiberoptic systems in various stages of com-\npletion, including communication links in an entire city in Japan, communication\nlines in populated "corridors such as cities near the east and west coasts of the\nUnited States, Canada\'s extensive link, cable TV system, and so on, not only in\nthe United States, but throughout the world. Even in New Mexico, a state that\nhas extensive copper mining interests, glass fibers are replacing copper wires in\nan extensive communications cable connecting high-tech communities along the\nRio Grande corridor, including Los Alamos National Laboratory in the north,\nthrough Albuquerque\'s facilities, past Socorro\'s School of Mines, ending in the\nNew Mexico State University campus at Las Cruces.\nCompetition in communications by fiberoptics will come from an exten-\nsive satellite system, but cost, security, weather, and other considerations pre-\nclude satellite competition for the current high rate of expansion of the fiberop-\nsics industry. Society, even in underdeveloped countries, will benefit from this\napplication of laser technology\nThe future of fiber communications appears bright according to\nMollenauer of AT&T Bell Laboratories in his invited talk at the 1985 Optical\nSociety of America Annual Meeting and reported in the May 1986 Optics News\n(6) "In an all optical fiber system--one without electronic repeaters-a single\ntiber could transmit as much as 100 Gbit/sec over thousands of kilometers. Such\nperformance would be obtained by using optical gain to overcome fiber loss and\nby transmitting the signals as nonspreading, soliton pulses." According to\narticle, the soliton is a pulse of the proper shape and critical peak power, su\nthat etlects of index nonlinearity exactly cancel dispersive broadening. The\ncon laser is described in Optical Letters 9 and 13 (1985) by Mollenauer and\nStolen (6)\nIn a conventional communications long-distance fiber optics system,\noptical signals are detected and electronically regenerated every 2010\nbefore continuing along the next span of fiber, and the electronic repeat\ntates to Goitsee or less per channel. An all optical signal system would\ncome the tiber losses by making the fiber itself a distributed amplifier\nthe use of the stimulated Raman effect. Technical details of this appro\ndescribed by Mollenauer, and reference is made to other investige\nThe concept of viewing a two-dimensional photograph" that yields a third di-\nmension intrigued the inventor of holography, Dennis Gabor. He conceived the\nidea in 1947, demonstrated it in 1948, and received the Nobel Prize in 1971 for\nhis efforts. The first demonstration was with ordinary light, but the invention of\nthe laser provided another source: coherent light. Other investigators, notably\nEmmett Leith and Juris Upatnieks, took an interest in the concept using lasers,\nand it was not long before this intriguing visual experience of observing the\n"whole message" (from the Greek holos and gramma and coined by Gabor as\nholography) was adapted to research and industrial uses as well as accepted as an\nart form.\nHolograms are becoming so readily available that National Geographic\nmagazine has featured them on two recent covers: for the March 1984 issue (a\nlaser-sculpted eagle); and for the November 1985 issue an image of the skeleton\nhead of Africa\'s Toung child, claimed to be one to two million years old). A mu-\nseum in New York City is dedicated to the art of holography. Mass-produced\nnovelties are widely available, even holographic greeting cards. It is possible to\ncomputerize three-dimensional holographic signals and plot such images. It ap-\npears that 3-D television is not far from reality. By projecting these images, mov-\ning objects can be transmitted in space so that future Super Bowls may eventually\nbe played on living room floors. (Demonstrations of this technique were person.\nally viewed at laser exhibits in the late 1970s.)\nThe following article by the Associated Press appeared in the July 23, 1986,\nedition of the Albuquerque Journal\nMassachusetts Institute of Technology researchers unveiled a refine-\nment on holography that allows them to project a three-dimensional\npicture in the air.\nPrevious holograms were confined to special chambers, usually\nmade of glass.\nThe MIT scientists said their floating images, much like one de-\npicted in the science-fiction movie "Star Wars, can be designed on a\nterated every 20 to 100 km\nelectronic repeaters limit\nsystem would over-\na distributed amplifier through\ntails of this approach are\nother investigators who have\n'
